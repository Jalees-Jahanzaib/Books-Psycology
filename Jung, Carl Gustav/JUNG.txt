Carl Gustav Jung - Collected Works and Letters (62 books)

CARL GUSTAV JUNG (1875-1961) was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology.  His work has been profoundly influential in the fields of psychiatry, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, and religious studies.

During the time Jung worked as a research scientist at the famous Burghölzli hospital, under Eugen Bleuler, he came to the attention of Sigmund Freud.  The two men conducted a lengthy correspondence and collaborated, for a while, on a joint vision of human psychology.  Freud saw in the younger Jung the potential heir he had been seeking to carry on his "new science" of psychoanalysis.  Jung's research and personal vision, however, made it impossible for him to bend to his older colleague's doctrine, and a schism became inevitable.  This division was personally painful for Jung, and it was to have historic repercussions lasting well into the modern day.

Among the central concepts of analytical psychology is individuation -- the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements.  Jung considered it to be the main task of human development.  He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including synchronicity, archetypal phenomena, the collective unconscious, the psychological complex, and extraversion and introversion.

The authoritative English collection of all his published writings is THE COLLECTED WORKS OF C. G. JUNG, 2nd ed., in 20 volumes (1966-79).  Most were not written by Jung as books, but are collections of papers, essays, lectures, letters, etc. written from 1902 until his death in 1961, and compiled by editors from 1945 onward.  The series contains revised versions of works previously published, works not previously translated, and new translations of many of Jung's writings.  Several of the volumes are extensively illustrated; each contains an index and most contain a bibliography.  Among the many other notable works that have appeared since his death is MEMORIES, DREAMS, REFLECTIONS (1962), an engrossing semi-autobiography partly written by Jung himself and partly recorded by his secretary; THE RED BOOK (2009), a manuscript that records his fantasies and induced hallucinations, and includes his own colour illustrations; and the multiple volumes of his always fascinating correspondence with colleagues and friends.
